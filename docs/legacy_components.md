# Legacy components

QuASAr previously carried a `legacy_code/QuantumGatePath.py` prototype that
experimented with a gate-centric path representation for circuits.  The module
was never integrated with the production planner or test-suite and duplicated
functionality already covered by the modern `quasar` package.  The prototype has
now been removed from the source tree to keep the distribution and documentation
focused on maintained components.

Any archival references should link to Git history prior to this change if the
experimental implementation is still of interest.
