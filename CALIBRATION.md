# Calibration

The cost estimator used by QuASAr relies on a set of coefficients that
scale simple analytical models to the actual performance of the machine
where conversions are executed.  The values can be tuned using small
microâ€‘benchmarks bundled with the project.

The matrix product state (MPS) calibration distinguishes between costs
for single- and two-qubit gates and an additional optional
singular-value-decomposition (SVD) truncation step.  Separate
coefficients for these components are produced by the calibration
script.

## Running the benchmarks

Run the calibration script to measure the cost of the supported
simulation backends and conversion primitives:

```bash
python -m quasar.calibration --output coeff.json
```

A JSON file with the measured coefficients will be written to
`coeff.json`.  The file can be supplied to :class:`~quasar.cost.CostEstimator`
when creating an estimator instance:

```python
from quasar import CostEstimator
est = CostEstimator.from_file("coeff.json")
```

Existing estimators can be updated in place using the measured values:

```python
from quasar import run_calibration

coeff = run_calibration()
estimator = CostEstimator()
estimator.update_coefficients(coeff)
```

To persist coefficients from an existing estimator:

```python
estimator.to_file("coeff.json")
```

These utilities allow coefficients to be tuned once and reused across
runs on the same hardware.
